1.Azure Virtual Network --> Created as a home or container for VMs. A VN is assigned a range of IP addresses. 
                            Within this range you can create a subnet whose IP range will be within the IP address range of the VN.
                            Within the subnet you can have resources who inturn can be assigned IPs from the range assigned to the subnet.
                            These IPs are private IPs and are used for communication within the VN only. 
                            For exposure to the outside world a public IP needs to be assigned.
                            For a VM to be added to an existing VN we have to make sure that both share the same region/location.
2. Application Security Groups --> Used to control traffic within servers hosted in the same group, so we can logically group together DB servers and web servers and handle
                                   traffic differently.
3.Vritual Network Peering --> When connecting two virtual networks together we can use virtual network peering. Here we create a private IP address between two VNs
                              and then the VMs in both VNs can start talking to each other with the help of this private IP
4.Point to Site VPN Connection --> Use case if when we want to connect a few VMs to a virtual network over the internet. To make this connection more secure
                                   we can use a VPN gateway which will enable a point to site connection tot he private IP of the virtual network. THis whole handshake happens 
                                   via certificates. 
5.Site to Site VPN connection -> USed when an on prem DC needs to connec to the Azure network. The on prem DC needs to have a routing device which has a public IP address.
                                 The Azure network needs to have a VPN gateway and a local network gateway(which stores public IP of the routing device).
6.Azure ExpressRoute --> Allows connections to Azure network using dedicated internet line. Special hardware is needed and patners in the region need to be available.                                 
                                 
-----------------------
AZURE STORAGE ACCOUNTS
-----------------------
Storage account name needs to be unique across azure i.e. no two people on earth can use the same name.

1. Blob Storage or containers --> Used to store object like data such as files, videos, images etc. Blob storage is also used as data disks for VMs and in this case the 
data is stored as VHD or virtual harddisk type files. Blobs have different access tiers Hot, Cool and Archive. For storage only Hot access tier has the highest prices whilst
the archive tier is lowest pricest. However whilst accessing the data, Hot acces tier is lower priced i.e.to store data in hot tier you have to pay more
but to access data in hot tier you have to pay less. These costs also depend on the operation i.e. read, write etc.

2. Table Storage --> Store data in table form similar to a NOSQL DB.

3. File Storage -->. File shares which can be ysed to share files between users or systems. This file sharing uses the SMB protocol. They are different from te 
                     Blob storage in a sense that you can directly connect to a fileshare and don't have to use URLS to access each file.
                     You can also have multiple systems connect to same fileshare. On file share you can also make directories.

4. Queues --> Queues are used for managing communications across systems where one system can write to a message queue and the other system can read from the queue.

Redundancy --> Locally redundant means copies of data will be stored on different servers in same DC
               Zone redundant means copies of data will be stoerd in different DCs in the same region.
               Geo redundant means copies of data will be stored in different regions.

-----------------------
AZURE DATABASES
-----------------------
1. Commissioning a DB can be done by spinning up a VM and then installing the DB separately or using PaaS i.e. available DBs as service.
2. Both approaches have their pros and cons.
3. Spinning up VM and isntalling DB gives you control over the versions but has overhead of implementing the high availability, scheduling backup and patching of DB.
4. When using PaaS DB 99.99% availability is ensured. Patching, backup and maintenance are handled by Azure.
5. Azure SQl Managed INstance --> This is an option when the company moving to cloud already has an SQL Server licenese and simply wants to lift and shift it to cloud. Provides 
                                   automated backups, patching and maintenance. This can also be added to vrtual network.
6. Azure MySQL & PostgreSQL --> Fully managed service to create a mysql DB. Pros and cons are same as other managed instances i.e point #5                                   


-----------------------
AZURE DATA WAREHOUSE
-----------------------
1. Called Azure Synapse. Will need a Gen2 account
2. In the synapse workspace you can create sqlpools which are similar to a normal DB but has a lot more different features.Azure data factory is used to copy data from DBs
to data warehouses.

-----------------------
AZURE COSMOS DB
-----------------------
1. NoSQL DB offering by Azure.
2. It's fully managed and hence backup, maintenance and patching is handled by Azure.
3. Various APIs such as SQL API, Table API, MongoDb API, cassandra API and Gremlin APi available to query various types of data.

-----------------------
AZURE DataBricks
-----------------------
1. Based on apache spark and used in BigData and ML to analyse large data sets.
2. It is fully managed.

-----------------------
Scalability
-----------------------
1. Resources scheduled on Azure can increase in storage, memory etc based on the need of the application. This is how Azure helps us to achieve scalability.
2. ScaleSet is another good example which the VMs can be a part of and the scaleset wil automatically increase or decrease the number of VMs available based
on traffic or load.
3. Deploying ap on each VM of the scaleset is responsibility of the developers.

-----------------------
Elascicity 
-----------------------
1. Elasticity is how fast the system can scale.

-----------------------
Aure Load Balancer
-----------------------
1. Backend pool needs to be configured which contains a list of IPs of all VMs.
2. The backend pool is then attached to the load balancer. The users can they hit IP of load balancer which redirects to a VM.
3. A heartbeat or healtcheck also needs to be in place to make sure all VMs are healthy.
4. Load balancer rules also need to be in place to route traffic.
5. This is also a local resoruce, hence it can only route traffic in the particular region in which the load balancer was created.

-----------------------
ARM Templates
-----------------------
1. Instead of manually creating resources we can use JSON file to create resources. 
2. The important contents of the ARM template file are parameters, resources, variables and output.
3. Resources are just the name of the resource you want to create such as VM, Azure storega account etc. Each resource can be created using different
API versions available in the microsoft docs. Each API version will have some features different from other API version.
4. Parameters are used to supply certain values that we can choose whislt creating the resources. For example, types of redundancy can by supplied as parameter and then whilst 
creating the resource AZure will ask you to select which type of redundancy you want.

-----------------------
Azure Traffic Manager
-----------------------
1. DNS based routing service provided by Azure.
2. Can route traffic globally based on DNS to either Azure or even on prem systems.
3. Routing can be priority based or weightage based.


-----------------------
Azure Serverless Services
-----------------------
1. All underlying infra managed by Azure and we can just run code.
2. Azure functions are an example of serverless ervices. An advantage of this is that you are only billed for the duration the function runs.

-----------------------
Aure Advisor 
-----------------------
1. Provides recommendations based on cost, security, high availability, etc. 

-----------------------
Application Insight 
-----------------------
1. Monitor web apps
2. Detect anomalies in the application.
3. Diagnose issues.
4. Can also help understand user behaviour of the application.
5. Can also help improve performance and usability.
6. Works by installing an SDK.
7. Some of the metrics recorded are request rates, resposne times, failure rates, page views and their load time, user and session counts, performance
counter of underlying VMs
8.***FUNNELS --> Create funnel from one stage of app to another to understand how users are progressing through different stages of the funnel
9.***User Flows --> Helps visualize how users navigate the app. Helps understand user behaviour such as page clicks, where the clicks happen, which page users spend most time, etc.
10.***IMpact --> Helps decide if page is having an impact on user i.e. load time is affecting user behavior
11.***Retention --> Helps understand how many people return to the application


-----------------------
Azure Devops
-----------------------
1. Azure boards is similar tot JIRA
2. Azure Repos is similar to Github
3. Azure pipelines is similar to Ci/CD available in Gitlab
4. Azure releases is similar to release pipeline

-----------------------
Azure DevTestLabs
-----------------------
1. Preconfigured set bases(base OS) or Azure Resource manager template based machines which are created and handed over to developers.
2. Help in faster creation of VMs.
3. Can be used to cost and time control.Auto shutdown and autostart policies can be put in place.
4. Size of VMs can also be configured

----------------------------------------------
Conditional Access Policies
----------------------------------------------
1. Need Azure AD  premium P2 license.
2. Prepare policies based on certiain conditions so that extra authentication will be forced. 
3. These policies can be such as user groups, apps, services etc.

----------------------------------------------
Role Based Access Control
----------------------------------------------
1. owner role has access to everything
2. Contributor role has access to everything except access management.

----------------------------------------------
Management Groups
----------------------------------------------
1. These are one level above subscription groups.
2. A good use case if if yo u wants to have different departments within your org under different subscriptions you can club these departments into management groups.
3. Each subscription group can then have different resources groups and so on.
4. ***TENANT ROOT GORUP is the default manangemenet group.

----------------------------------------------
Azure Resource locks
----------------------------------------------
1. CAn be applied at resource, resource group or subscription level.
2. ***CannotDelete --> Allowed to modify and read resource but not delete.
3. ***ReadOnly --> Read only, no delete or modify.

----------------------------------------------
Azure Security Center & Azure Sentinel
----------------------------------------------
1. Inbuilt service that assess the deployed resources and provides some suggestions to make the security better.
2. Azure Sentinel does more than just monitoring, it assess logs and information from vaiour sources both cloud and onprem and provides insight into 
application security.

----------------------------------------------
Azure Blueprints
----------------------------------------------
1. Deploy resources based on Azure Resource Manage Templates, policies, resources groups and role based access.
2. Blueprint can obly be defined at management group or subscription level, it cannot be defined at resource group level.
3. The use of blueprint is when large organizations require certain management groups to have same architecture. In this case you 
can create a blueprint template and apply to that management group. From this amnagement group you can then choose which resource group to apply it to.
Stages of BLUEPRINT are
 a) Definition -> define the blueprint. To save the blueprint you need contributor access.
 b) Publishing -> Publish the blueprint, a blueprint can have different versions
 c) Assign -> Assign blueprint to subscription.
 4. Blueprint can also have locks.
 
 ----------------------------------------------
Other security aspects
----------------------------------------------
 1. GDPR --> applies to people living in EU and tells us that data needs to be collected legally
 2. ISO --> International Standards Organization 
 3. NIST --> US organization which monitors science, technology and innovation.
 4. Azure service trust portal has various audit reports.
 
1. GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
This is a set of rules that helps EU citizens have more control over their personal data
Under this compliance schema, organizations have to ensure that personal data is gathered legally and under strict conditions.
Also organizations have to manage the data in such a way that it is protected from misuse or exploitation.

2. ISO (International Organization for Standardization)
This is an international body that is responsible for setting international standards.
This is an independent, non-government organization.
It consists of members from around 160+ member countries.

3. NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)
This is an organization which looks at U.S. innovation.
They do this by looking at measurement of science, standards and technology.
 
----------------------------------------------
Azure Updates

1. Contains information baout latest offerings from Azure.
2. Services can either be generally available or in previews.
3. Peview is also divided into two types, public preview and private preview.
4. Public preview is services that are available for anyone to try out
5. Private preview are services where you need to contact microsoft to try them out
6. Preview services have NO SLA
7. Don't use in PROD.

----------------------------------------------
Costing
----------------------------------------------
1. Storage is charged based on volumn, number of operations and redundancy
2. Inbound data transfer into Azure is free
3. Outbound data tansfer from Azure is charged
4. Inbound and Outbound data transfer from Azure for virtual machines hosted in anavailability zone is charged.
5. Data transfer between services locateed in same region but not part of availability zone is free
6. Inbound data transfer between services located in different regions is also fee.
6. Outbound data tansfer between services located in different regions is charged.
