1.Azure Virtual Network --> Created as a home or container for VMs. A VN is assigned a range of IP addresses. 
                            Within this range you can create a subnet whose IP range will be within the IP address range of the VN.
                            Within the subnet you can have resources who inturn can be assigned IPs from the range assigned to the subnet.
                            These IPs are private IPs and are used for communication within the VN only. 
                            For exposure to the outside world a public IP needs to be assigned.
                            For a VM to be added to an existing VN we have to make sure that both share the same region/location.
2. Application Security Groups --> Used to control traffic within servers hosted in the same group, so we can logically group together DB servers and web servers and handle
                                   traffic differently.
3.Vritual Network Peering --> When connecting two virtual networks together we can use virtual network peering. Here we create a private IP address between two VNs
                              and then the VMs in both VNs can start talking to each other with the help of this private IP
4.Point to Site VPN Connection --> Use case if when we want to connect a few VMs to a virtual network over the internet. To make this connection more secure
                                   we can use a VPN gateway which will enable a point to site connection tot he private IP of the virtual network. THis whole handshake happens 
                                   via certificates. 
5.Site to Site VPN connection -> USed when an on prem DC needs to connec to the Azure network. The on prem DC needs to have a routing device which has a public IP address.
                                 The Azure network needs to have a VPN gateway and a local network gateway(which stores public IP of the routing device).
6.Azure ExpressRoute --> Allows connections to Azure network using dedicated internet line. Special hardware is needed and patners in the region need to be available.

AZURE STORAGE ACCOUNTS
-----------------------
Storage account name needs to be unique across azure i.e. no two people on earth can use the same name.

1. Blob Storage or containers --> Used to store object like data such as files, videos, images etc. Blob storage is also used as data disks for VMs and in this case the 
data is stored as VHD or virtual harddisk type files. Blobs have different access tiers Hot, Cool and Archive. For storage only Hot access tier has the highest prices whilst
the archive tier is lowest pricest. However whilst accessing the data, Hot acces tier is lower priced i.e.to store data in hot tier you have to pay more
but to access data in hot tier you have to pay less. These costs also depend on the operation i.e. read, write etc.

2. Table Storage --> Store data in table form similar to a relational DB

3. File Storage -->. File shares which can be ysed to share files between users or systems. This file sharing uses the SMB protocol

4. Queues --> Queues are used for managing communications across systems where one system can write to a message queue and the other system can read from the queue.

Redundancy --> Locally redundant means copies of data will be stored on different servers in same DC
               Zone redundant means copies of data will be stoerd in different DCs in the same region.
               Geo redundant means copies of data will be stored in different regions.
